		<p class="tagline">When your campaign is in the planning stages, it’s easy to feel overwhelmed. There’s so much to think about! Who is your audience? Whose voices are you taking into account? How do you balance short-term goals with the long-term change we want to see? What are our assumptions and where are our blind spots? Is everyone clear on what the campaign hopes to accomplish?</p>

		<h1>Before You Start A Campaign</h1>
		<p class="indent">Stories are all around us, but they don’t emerge from the thin air. We create them. They come from our words, yes, but also from our choices, our actions, and the way we organize ourselves. Our narratives begin to unfold before we consciously begin writing them. This is why some of our most important work as activists occurs before the campaign even starts.</p>
		<p class="indent">Begin by understanding these three foundations of your story:

Good storytellers are mindful of how their tales interact with those already in circulation.

			<p class="indent">Note: We believe in a democratic, participatory method for surfacing our stories. This is both a matter of values and of pragmatism. The most powerful narratives come from welcoming in different voices and diverse communities, not shutting them out. So gather your whole team or as many diverse points of views as you can, and let’s get started.

		<h1>Crafting A Story</h1>
		<p class="indent">The story you tell through your campaign is not so different from one you’d find in a novel, a movie, a myth, or a play. And like those stories, yours will have certain elements. There will be characters, settings, conflict, and plots. If you want to maximize the impact of your story, you’ll need to be as thoughtful about each of these elements as any novelist or filmmaker. This might sound daunting, but don’t worry — every campaign has a story to tell. And here we’ll present some techniques for helping you find yours.</p>

Draw it well and put it on display, for to readers it is a mirror and a magnet.” ~Francis Flaherty, The New York Times" link_text_1="Read More" link_url_1="#who" attachment_2="312" title_2="What" description_2="There is no story without conflict. Conflict propels the action forward. It inspires characters to act. It lets the audience know what’s at stake. To identify the conflict that’s driving your story, ask: What does your protagonist want? What’s preventing them from having it? And who is standing in the way?" link_text_2="Read More" link_url_2="#what" attachment_3="328" title_3="Where" description_3="The setting is the world of your story. Think of the place that your characters inhabit. What does it look like? What does it smell and sound like? How does it make your characters feel? Are they hopeful for its future? Are they concerned about it’s present path? Does it make them feel safe? Vulnerable? What physical details about this place reveal deeper truths? Be specific in your description. It will help bring the world of your story alive for your audience." link_text_3="Read More" link_url_3="#where" /]

		[shortcake_static_four_column attachment_1="315" title_1="How &amp; Why" description_1="Characters provide the “who” of your story. Conflict gives you the “what,” and setting offers the “where.” With the plot, you answer the questions of “how” and “why.” A plot consists of the individual events that make up your narrative—it’s “how”—and a causal connection that tells you “why” they happened. That connection is important. It’s the thread that ties your plot together." link_text_1="Read More" link_url_1="#how" attachment_2="312" title_2="Frames" description_2="Any issue can be looked at from multiple perspectives. Take climate change, for example. It’s clearly an environmental issue, but we could also see it as a human rights issue, a security issue, a moral issue, and an economic issue. When choosing how you want to portray your issue, you are choosing a frame. A frame is the lens through which you are representing an issue, and it has great power to shape your audience’s understanding." link_text_2="Read More" link_url_2="#frames" attachment_3="328" title_3="Strategies for Storytelling" description_3="Narratives are always in battle with each other.
