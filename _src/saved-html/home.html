	<h2>What Is Storytelling?</h2>
	<p>Stories are the connective tissue of humanity. They help us decide which futures are possible, and how those futures may be brought into being. If we pay attention to the stories that a culture holds dear, we discover its deep structure. We learn what is most important to people, what they value, and what they disregard.</p>

	<h2>Storytelling As a Theory of Change</h2>
	<p>Storytellers aren’t content with the stories that already exist. They have something new to say. Storytellers recognise which stories circulate in their culture, and understand that they can broken apart and rewritten: this is story as a theory of change, the idea behind the saying “change the story, change the world” Storytellers aim to show us part of the world we haven’t seen before, or to help us see that world from an unfamiliar angle. When we expand our vision, we expand the range of what seems possible. In this way, storytelling gives us the power to make change.</p>

	<p>Like all sources of power, storytelling is shaped by access. As you begin to write your story, it’s important to consider who’s holding the pen. Whose voice gets heard, and whose is missed? Do your storytellers reflect your audience, or do they come across as outsiders? To tell powerful stories, your process must be empowering. It must be open, equitable, and in line with your values.</p>
